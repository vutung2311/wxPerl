WXPERL INSTALLATION

QUICK INSTALLATION

unpack the wxPerl archive
cd to wxPerl directory
perl Makefile.PL   # (1) (2)
make               # (3)
make test          # (4)
make install       # (5)

1) this step will output the compilation flags derived from
   wxWindows (for debugging purpouses)
2) see below for a way to specify a different installation directory
3) under Windows you may need to use nmake, or another *make
4) you may also want to do
   perl run minimal
   perl run controls
   ...
   against the samples in the 'samples' subdirectory
   before installing
5) you may need administrator/root privileges to install

SPECIFYING THE INSTALLATION PATH

If you don't want to install wxPerl as a system module, you must
specify a different installation path. Usually you do this with

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=path

however, depending on your Perl setup, you may need different options:
in my Win2k system, ActivePerl build 620, I use

perl Makefile.PL LIB=path

In my Debian 2.2 system (Perl 5.005_03 and 5.004_05 shipped with
 Debian), I use

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=path INSTALLSITELIB=path INSTALLMAN3DIR=manpath

With the Perl 5.004_04 I built from sources ( in my Debian system ) I use

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=path

Depending on your setup you may need other options: che complete list
is on the ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage

perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker 

for details.

ADDITIONAL FLAGS

In addition to ExtUtils::MakeMaker flags wxPerl Makefile.PL accepts

* DEBUG={0|1} 
  Currently only under Win32 VC++ ( and MinGW, but is not tested )
  adds debugging information to the library

* EXTRA_LIBS={extra libraries}
  Adds extra libraries to the link command line

* EXTRA_CFLAGS={extra compiler flags}
  Adds extra compiler flags to compiler line

SPECIFYING C++ COMPILER

wxPerl needs a C++ compiler to build itself. Under Windows there is no
problem, since there are only 2 supported compilers. Under Unix, if
your Perl was built with GCC all should be fine, otherwise wxPerl does
nothing and warns you at Makefile.PL time; in this case you will almost 
surely need to add some special flags ( via EXTRA_CFLAGS ) or to specify 
a different compiler ( via perl Makefile.PL CC=c++-compiler ).
 
COMPILING UNDER WIN32

This wxPerl version was tested with MinGW 2.95.2-1 and MS Visual C++ 5.
For the remainder of this section I'll assume that your Perl is installed
in C:\Perl

* MS Visual C++ 5 ( and probably 4.x and 6.x, but I've not tested it )

  If you've built Perl from sources, then the plain install ( see above )
  should work. If you're using ActivePerl with MSVC != 6.x you may
  experience linking problems ( Can't seek to position XXXXXX ... ),
  then you need to rebuild the perl56.dll import library.

  Use the make_implib.pl script ( included in the wxPerl distribution ):
  Make a backup of C:\Perl\lib\CORE\Perl56.lib, then do

  perl script/make_implib.pl --target=vc C:\Perl\bin\Perl56.dll

  This will create a file Perl56.lib; copy this file to C:\Perl\lib\CORE\ .

* MinGW GCC 2.95.2-1

  If you built Perl from sources then the plain install ( see above )
  should work. If you're using ActivePerl, then the procedure is a
  little more complicated, see install_mingw.txt for an explanation
