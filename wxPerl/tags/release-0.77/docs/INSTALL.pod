Install - Build and install wxPerl

=head1 wxPerl installation

    ************************************************************************
    You need to install wxWidgets before you can compile wxPerl.
    For UNIX systems look at the section "INSTALL wxWidgets"; for Win32
    systems, detailed build instructions for wxWidgets + wxPerl are included
    in the section "COMPILING UNDER WIN32"; for Mac OS X, refer to
    "INSTALL wxWidgets", and then to "USING wxPerl on MAC OS X"
    ************************************************************************

=head1 Quick installation

This applies to UN*X systems, and only if wxWidgets is already
compiled and installed.

    # unpack the wxPerl archive
    tar xzvf Wx-0.xx.tar.gz
    cd Wx-0.xx
    perl Makefile.PL   # (1)
    make               # (2)
    make test          # (3)
    make install       # (4)

1) see below for a way to specify a different installation directory

2) under Windows you may need to use nmake, or another *make

3) you may also want to do

     perl run minimal
     perl run controls
     ...

against the samples in the 'samples' subdirectory, and

   perl demo/demo.pl

before installing

4) you may need Administrator/root privileges to install

=head1 Additional flags to Makefile.PL

In addition to ExtUtils::MakeMaker flags wxPerl Makefile.PL accepts

  --debug

Currently only under Win32 or GCC
adds debugging information to the library

  --extra-libs={extra libraries}

Adds extra libraries to the link command line

  --extra-cflags={extra compiler flags}

Adds extra compiler flags to compiler line

  --help

=head1 Installing wxWidgets (on UNIX systems and Mac OS X)

For UNIX systems only. If you are using prepackaged wxWidgets binaries you
need to install the -dev and -contrib-dev packages in order to compile
wxPerl, otherwise you just need the main package and the -contrib package.
If you are compiling wxWidgets yourself, the quick way is:

  ./configure
  make
  make install
  cd contrib/src/stc
  make
  make install
  # only for wxWidgets 2.5.2 or below
  cd ../xrc
  make
  make install

If something goes wrong, please refer to the wxWidgets
installation instructions.

=head1 Installing under Win32

This wxPerl version was tested with MinGW 3.0 and MS Visual C++ 5.
Older MinGW versions (from 1.1 onwards) and newer versions will likely work.
For the remainder of this section I'll assume that your Perl is installed
in C:\Perl

=head2 MS Visual C++ 5 (wxWidgets 2.4.x), MS Visual C++ 6 SP4 (wxWidgets 2.4.x)

  Build wxWidgets as a dll

  set WXDIR=z:\path\to\wx
  set WXWIN=z:\path\to\wx
  cd %WXDIR%\src\msw
  nmake -f makefile.vc FINAL=1 dll
  cd %WXDIR%\contrib\src\stc
  nmake -f makefile.vc FINAL=1 WXUSINGDLL=1
  cd %WXDIR%\contrib\src\xrc
  nmake -f makefile.vc FINAL=1 WXUSINGDLL=1

  # build wxPerl
  perl Makefile.PL
  nmake
  nmake test
  nmake install

To build the debugging version apply this patch to wxWidgets:

    Index: src/makevc.env

    ==CUT BEFORE THIS LINE AND STRIP 4 LEADING SPACES

then follow the instructions above, passing FINAL=hybrid to wxWidgets
makefiles, and --debug to Makefile.PL.

=head2 MinGW 1.1 or later (wxWidgets 2.4.x)

Get MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/ ; choose the all-in-one
package (downloading the individual packages will work but requires
you knowing how to install them). MSYS is not required.

If you want to compile wxPerl against ActivePerl using MinGW,
you need to first download and install ExtUtils::FakeConfig from
http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/ap_mingw/ ; then just replace the
"perl Makefile.PL" with "perl -MConfig_m Makefile.PL". If you built
Perl from sources, you don't need this additional step.

Build wxWidgets as a dll (you will need the utilities from
http://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/pub/ports/mingw32/extra.zip )

  set WXDIR=z:\path\to\wx
  set WXWIN=z:\path\to\wx
  cd z:\path\to\wx\src\msw
  make -f makefile.g95 FINAL=1 WXMAKINGDLL=1
  cd %WXDIR%\contrib\src\stc
  make -f makefile.g95 FINAL=1 WXUSINGDLL=1
  cd %WXDIR%\contrib\src\xrc
  make -f makefile.g95 FINAL=1 WXUSINGDLL=1

  # now build wxPerl
  # get dmake from http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/GSAR/dmake-4.1pl1-win32.zip
  perl Makefile.PL
  dmake
  dmake test
  dmake install

To build a debugging wxPerl, follow the instructions above passing
FINAL=0 to wxWidgets makefile and --debug to Makefile.PL.

=head2 MS Visual C++ 5 (wxWidgets 2.5.x), MS Visual C++ 6 SP4 (wxWidgets 2.5.x)

Build wxWidgets as a dll

  cd z:\path\to\wx\build\msw
  nmake -f makefile.vc SHARED=1 BUILD=release
  cd ..\..\contrib\build\stc
  nmake -f makefile.vc SHARED=1 BUILD=release
  # only for wxWidgets 2.5.2 or below
  cd ..\xrc
  nmake -f makefile.vc SHARED=1 BUILD=release

  # build wxPerl
  set WXDIR=z:\path\to\wx
  set WXWIN=z:\path\to\wx

  perl Makefile.PL
  nmake
  nmake test
  nmake install

To build a debugging wxPerl, follow the instructions above passing
BUILD=debug DEBUG_RUNTIME_LIBS=0 to wxWidgets makefile and --debug
to Makefile.PL.

=head2 MinGW 1.1 or later (wxWidgets 2.5.x)

Get MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/ ; choose the all-in-one
package (downloading the individual packages will work but requires
you knowing how to install them). MSYS is not required.

If you want to compile wxPerl against ActivePerl using MinGW,
you ned to first download and install ExtUtils::FakeConfig from
http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/ap_mingw/ ; then just replace the
"perl Makefile.PL" with "perl -MConfig_m Makefile.PL". If you built
Perl from sources, you don't need this additional step.

Build wxWidgets as a dll

  cd z:\path\to\wx\build\msw
  make -f makefile.gcc SHARED=1 BUILD=release
  cd ..\..\contrib\src\stc
  make -f makefile.gcc SHARED=1 BUILD=release
  # only for wxWidgets 2.5.2 or below
  cd ..\xrc
  make -f makefile.gcc SHARED=1 BUILD=release

  # now build wxPerl
  # get dmake from http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/GSAR/dmake-4.1pl1-win32.zip
  set WXDIR=z:\path\to\wx
  set WXWIN=z:\path\to\wx

  perl Makefile.PL
  dmake
  dmake test
  dmake install

To build a debugging wxPerl, follow the instructions above passing
BUILD=debug to wxWidgets makefile and --debug to Makefile.PL.

=head1 Specifying the installation path

If you don't want to install wxPerl as a system module, you must
specify a different installation path. With recent ExtUtils::MakeMaker
you can do this by using

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=path

On older ExtUtils::MakeMaker version the correct incantation
might be different.

=head1 Using wxPerl on Mac OS X

The 'perl' executable shipped with your OS can't be used to run executables
that interact with the GUI, hence you need to use the special 'wxPerl'
executable created by wxPerl.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 Problems compiling XRC and/or STC

Usually they start like this:

  STC.c:33:24: wx/stc/stc.h: No such file or directory

and go ahead with many compilation errors.
This usually means you did not install wxWidgets' 'contrib' libraries;
either install them or disable STC/XRC passing --disable-stc --disable-xrc
to Makefile.PL.

=head2 C++ compiler

wxPerl needs a C++ compiler to build. By default it will use
the C++ compiler that was used to compile wxWidgets; this can cause
problems if Perl was compiled with a C compiler of a different brand.
For example if you compile Perl with GCC and wxWidgets with ICC or
Perl with Sun C compiler and wxWidgets with G++ you will most likely
not be able to compile wxPerl. Exceptions are: under Windows you can
use ActivePerl (compiled with MS Visual Studio) and wxWidgets compiled
with MinGW by using ExtUtils::FakeConfig, under Solaris a similar
tool exists for Sun C Compiler -> GCC/G++ compilation.
